# **App Name**: MentoraAI

## Core Features:

- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze user messages to detect emotion (Sad, Angry, Neutral, Happy) and its intensity using Google Gemini API. Use this analysis as a tool in determining which activities and responses are most appropriate. Consider keywords indicating critical distress for safety net activation.
- Empathetic Validation: Provide empathetic validation to the user based on the detected emotion using Google Gemini API. Craft validating opening responses such as, 'I hear you. It sounds like a really heavy day.' or 'I can see you're really angry right now. It's okay to let it out here.'
- Choice-Based Coping System: Present users with a choice of coping activities tailored to their detected emotion using Google Gemini API as a tool for selecting appropriate recommendations, such as creative puzzles for sadness or the 'Smash-the-Stress' AR mini-game for anger. Offer a 'just talk' option.
- Smash-the-Stress AR Mini-Game: Augmented reality mini-game where users can 'smash' virtual objects overlaid on their real-world environment using their phone's camera. The game includes a 'Stress Meter' that decreases with each smash, providing a visual representation of stress release.
- Guided Breathing Exercise: Provide a simple animation, such as an expanding/contracting circle, to guide the user through a 4-4-6 breathing pattern. An effective calming tool the user can choose at any time.
- Safety Net Protocol: Override all other modules and immediately provide a message with links and phone numbers to professional helplines if severe distress is detected at any point in the user's messages. The LLM is a tool in identifying high-priority messages requiring external intervention.
- 3D Chat Environment: Immersive 3D environment (e.g., a quiet forest, a starry night) where the AI is represented by a subtle, glowing orb, and chat messages appear as 3D objects. A calming, distraction-free environment for conversation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light, desaturated blue-gray (#E8E9EB) to evoke a sense of calm and serenity.
- Primary color: Medium-dark teal (#3F7CAC), a balanced color that represents clarity and emotional balance, will provide visual interest without being overstimulating.
- Accent color: Muted raspberry (#AC425A) to add a subtle touch of warmth and provide contrast. This will serve as a complement to the teal.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a humanist sans-serif style, as this font conveys both a modern look and a little warmth or personality; it is also suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use soft, rounded icons that reflect empathy and support. Keep the visual style consistent with the calming aesthetic of the app.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout with ample white space to avoid overwhelming users. Arrange elements to promote ease of navigation and readability.
- Employ subtle and gentle animations for transitions and interactions to create a soothing and engaging user experience.
